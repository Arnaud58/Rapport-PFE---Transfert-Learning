# Transfert Learning and Few-Shot Learning - State of the Art

This repo contain a LaTex report about Transfert Learning (TL) and few-shot learning.

I made this report with [Samy Barchid](https://github.com/Barchid) during our second year of Master degree. This work was supervised by MENNESSON Jos√© and TIRILLY Pierre, two researcher of the [FOX team](https://www.cristal.univ-lille.fr/equipes/fox/) at Cristal lab.

The report is in french and is mainly a state of the art and a study. The study is a comparaison between the use and the result of different Transfert Learning and Few-Shot Learning implementation.
